### Day 45 - Study about Principles and Patterns in Java Design.
**Date:** 01-Feb-2026
- Study the basic concepts of design principles and Patterns in Java.
- Some of the most used principles are :
  > - **OCP**: _Open For Extension Close for Modification._
  > - **SRP**: _Single Responsibility Principle_
  > - **DRY**: _Don't Repeat Yourself_
  > - **KISS**: _Keep It Simple, Stupid_
- Learn about the patterns, and some well-known patterns are:
  > - **Singleton Pattern**
  > - **Factory Pattern**
  > - **Builder Pattern**
  > - **UML Diagram**

### Day 46 - worked on java-design-pattern-practice branch
**Date:** 02-feb-2026
- worked on gcr-codebase on a new branch: java-design-pattern-practice
- Implemented concepts of design principles like GoF patterns.
- Created one singleton LibraryCatalog to ensure only one instance of the catalog exists to prevent inconsistencies.
- Implemented the Factory pattern so that the system can dynamically create user types at runtime.
- Implemented the Builder pattern to construct Book objects with optional attributes.
- Solved Smart University Library Management System problem statement.

### Day 47 - worked on java-design-pattern-practice branch
**Date:** 03-feb-2026
- worked on gcr-codebase on a new branch: java-design-pattern-practice
- Implemented concepts of Multithreading life cycle and States of thread in Java.
- Concepts learned _multi-threading_ , _Creating Threads Using Thread Class_ , _Thread Class vs Runnable Interface_ and many more...
- Solved problem 'Download manager' using Multithreading.

### Day 48 - Worked on java-design-pattern-practice branch
**Date:** 04-feb-2026
- Worked on gcr-codebase on the branch java-design-pattern-practice
- Implemented the concepts of Multithreading, threading, and threading constructors.
- Solved problem: ThreadStateMonitor used the TIMED_WAITING State in it.

### Day 49 - Worked on java-design-pattern-practice branch
**Date:** 05-feb-2026
- Worked on gcr-codebase on the branch java-design-pattern-practice
- Implemented the concepts of Multithreading, TERMINATED State, thread method like  _Start()_: _run()_
- Solved problems like: restaurant order, ShopJob, using these concepts

### Day 49 - Worked on java-design-pattern-practice branch
**Date:** 05-feb-2026
- Worked on scenario-based directory on the java-design-pattern-practice branch
- Implement a Customer class that represents a bank customer.
- Created a driver program (Main class) that simulates multiple customers interacting with the bank concurrently.
- Use Java's Thread class to represent customers performing transactions concurrently.
